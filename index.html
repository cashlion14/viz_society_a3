			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

      <figure style="position: relative; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; overflow: auto">
				<img src="Image 1.png" alt="" style="flex-shrink: 0; max-width: 100%;"/>
				<figcaption>
					This chart demonstrates the interconnectedness of the two censuses. When you plot them on one timeline, you can see that they tell a story spanning 200 years, back to the founding days of the nation. This helps put the census in context, and we can line the timeline up with some of the most seminal moments in American history.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I wanted to demonstrate that while these censuses represent a snapshot in time, they tell a story about all the time in between. By plotting on one timeline, the viewer can see how much history these censuses tell you about.</li>
				<li>This allowed me to look at any interesting trends in the slopes of the graphs. The most interesting is that as of 1900, the number of men born between1835 adn 1850 was lower than expected. This is because by 1900, many of them had died in the Civil War. This left a scar that you could see in the census, 50 years later. </li>
				<li>The size of the area under curves in this graph could also tell you something about how the population of the United States has grown over time. Since the two lines use a commmon y-axis, you can see how much larger the US was in 2000 than in 1900.</li>
			</ul>

      <figure style="position: relative; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; overflow: auto">
				<img src="Image 2.png" alt="" style="flex-shrink: 0; max-width: 100%;"/>
				<figcaption>
          Here, we look at a trend evident in the census: age! With the advent of modern medical technology and slowing birth rates, America has gotten older. The percent of people under twenty has fallen by around 40% from 1900.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>For the next sketch I wanted to focus on how American has gotten older. I knew from looking at the data that this was a big point, so I figured I would explore that data further. I chose to compare 1900 and 2000 separately, to explore the "screenshot in time" aspect of a census.</li>
				<li>I chose to color these charts in ways that would emphasize the youthful focus. Green is associated with nature, summer, life. And that is why I made the young portion of the chart green, while the other part of the chart is grey, older, representing age. </li>
				<li>I chose to make the title of my chart affective, to make clear the main point of my chart. Compared to the last one, this chart is less about exploration and more about conveying a message that I feel sure of. However, I thought that this chart didn't give much evidence of how America had gotten older. Was this because people were living longer, or because there were less young people being born?</li>
			</ul>

      <figure style="position: relative; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; overflow: auto">
				<img src="Image 3.png" alt="" style="flex-shrink: 0; max-width: 100%;"/>
				<figcaption>
          This graph looks at how the distribution of ages in the United States changed from the beginning to the end of the 20th century. Not only are more Americans older, they are living longer, and the largest generation is actually those around the age of 40. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>This chart allows me to bucket by age and compare how buckets compare to their partner in the other century and to other buckets in the same century. We can see that people are both living longer AND having relatively less children. </li>
				<li>One thing I thought was very important in my design choice was to use common scale on the x axis. This allows for the size of the bars to be accurate, and conveys the correct relationship between 1900 and 2000 at first glance.</li>
				<li>I chose to make the markings of the chart little people, to make immediately clear that it represented a population number. I thought it was cute, but when I showed it to some of my friends, they found it confusing and distracting. I resolved to change it for my final sketch.</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        In my sketch design, I think I began with the most creative and moved toward the most simple. However, to answer my question: “How did America change over the 20th century?” sometimes simple is better. It allows you to take the most pressing trends and present them thoughtfully, rather than going the extra mile and ending up making your audience confused. For example, my first sketch shows an interesting perspective: it puts people on the timeline by year of birth, showing the census as two centuries of lived experience rather than two points in time. However, it may confuse people with a false sense of population growth, since people need to take into account that the number counted for each year of birth is not all the people who were born in that year, but all those born in that year still alive at the time of the census. So I decided to go simpler, but still explore the age question. For my second graph, I played with color, and focused on the charts being two points in time. I think this chart is much more understandable, but it is kind of boring— green and grey is actually not a very fun color scheme. I also think that it doesn’t show enough information. So for my third chart, I enabled the viewer to see how age is split up among populations while also directly comparing 1900 to 2000. Keeping the x axes the same for both was important to allow a direct connection, while buckets gave more information that the circles. At the same time, I found out that color was the way to go. Drawing the bar charts with people was cute, but I received feedback that it was rather distracting. For the next phase, I want to take the best of all three. Use color to differentiate, make clear on first glance what I am trying to say, and show trends both within a census and across censuses.

			<h2>Phase Two: Final Design</h2>

			<figure style="position: relative; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; overflow: auto">
				<img src="Sheet 1.png" alt="" style="flex-shrink: 0; max-width: 100%;"/>
				<figcaption>
				We have converted our third sketch an actual image here, such that we can see the distribution of American ages over the last 100 years. We can see similar patterns, such that being young is not the expectation anymore. Rather, being between 40 and 50 is.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
				As I wrote in my phase one reflection, I learned a few lessons from my sketches. First, use color to differentiate. Second, make clear what I am trying to say immediately. Third, show trends within and across censuses. I chose to explore the same question as above, but to do it in a way that would accomplish these three goals. Based on my third sketch, I knew that Americans had both started to live longer and have less children during the twentieth century. I wanted to convey this in the most effective way possible. So I took my third sketch and I worked on it in tableau. I wanted to communicate that there are more Americans above 80, and that the most populous age in America is now 40-50, so I divided the age field into buckets of ten years. I also wanted to demonstrate how the US had grown as a whole compared to 1900. That meant that it was essential to make the X-axes the same scale. This allows people, just by glancing at the visualization, to know that the US has grown a lot in the last century.
			</p><p>
				After doing so, I plotted the data in Tableau. I reverse the axes so that both bar charts were growing from the same central point, and I sorted to put the youngest people at the bottom, as is customary for a population chart like this. In doing so, I make sure that people who have seen charts like this will be able to draw messages from it immediately. When I chose my colors, I decided to do away with patterns. I found the little humans of my sketch 3 to be distracting, and I wanted my message to be clear. Blue and red were used because they are inherently American colors, and we are looking at the American population. Furthermore, they contrast well and allow you to tell where the bar for 1900 ends and the one for 2000 begins.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        Although I feel like I’ve covered in detail the decisions that I made which affected my transition from phase 1 to phase 2, I think it is important to discuss how I thought sketching was helpful in general. Sketching allowed me to quickly iterate on my designs, which led to a better end product. I came away with a big lesson from each sketch chart that I applied to my final chart, and it vastly improved my end product. Furthermore, I had the chance to manually create these charts, which I felt sparked my creative process in a novel and interesting manner.
